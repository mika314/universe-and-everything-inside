## Chapter 1

The universe is enormous and populated with wondrous creatures. John is sleeping and smiling in his sleep. He has black hair, a potato‑shaped nose, and funny round ears. The young man lies down on the bed and hides under a purple blanket with a diamond pattern.

Seven o’clock in the morning. The sun rises over the horizon, and the world awakens. The birds chirp, and the wind whispers through the trees. The world is full of life. The radio alarm turns on, and the morning sun fills the room.

John wakes up and stretches. He yawns and rubs his eyes. He looks around the room and sees the familiar surroundings. He gets out of bed and puts on his slippers. He walks to the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth.

John studies at the university. He is going to become a car designer. Today he has math, chemistry, and English classes.

A young man goes to the kitchen to make breakfast. He opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, and a jar of jam. He makes a peanut‑butter and jelly sandwich and pours a glass of milk. He sits down at the table and eats his breakfast.

After finishing breakfast, he was thinking:

"Do I really need to go to math classes? Can I skip math and go to chemistry and English?"

John decided to skip math and go to bed for a nap.

At 11 o'clock in the morning, the sun's rays filled the room. The young man opened his eyes.

"Am I making it in time for chemistry? Looks like it is too late. Chemistry classes start at 11:15; I am going to be late." - this thought flies through the head of the young man.

He decided to skip chemistry classes, too.

Someone rings the doorbell. John opens the door. Sabina stands on the porch. She is a blond girl with green eyes and an upturned nose.

"Are you still at home? Did you decide to skip math, too?" asked Sabina.

"I am skipping Chemistry, too," John replied.

"Come on, let's go to Chemistry.

John takes his backpack and puts a couple of notebooks and a pen inside.

"Let's go."

John sits in the chemistry class and diligently writes notes after the professor. The blackboard is filled with chemistry formulas on the bottom right side of the board with small writing. The professor has a strange habit of writing only on one side of the board with small text, so students in the back row cannot read anything.

Sabina writes something on the post-it note, folds the note in half, and slides it to John.

John unfolds the note: "<3<3<3"

John looks into Sabina's eyes and smiles. Sabina smiles back.

On the break between classes, John and Sabina decided to go outside and sit on the bench. Next to the bench, two cats lay on the lawn and enjoyed the sun.

"Lucky cats, they don't need to study anything, just lying in the sun," Sabina nodded in the direction of the cats.

"We had dogs, and now we have cats," John noted.

"Huh, that is true, I didn't notice it before, you're right, it is strange."

The cat licked its paw and then turned to the other side.

After classes, the young man and the girl went to the café for lunch. John picked a sandwich with cheese and bologna and a can of Monster drink. Sabina ordered a salad. She sat at a table outside the café.

"Every time Professor Smith reads his lectures, I am getting extremely sleepy," John complained.

"He might be a vampire who is sucking the energy from people," Sabina suggested.

"What if people instead of eating normal food could get energy from information?"

"If we were ingesting information instead of normal food, I'd get a heartburn after lectures of Smith," Sabina chuckled.

John chuckled.

John and Sabina stopped talking and got into deep thought and chewing.

"In the morning you mentioned cats, look, one more cat," Sabina nodded in the direction of the cat.

"Strange, stray cat," John replied.

"Why is it strange to see a stray cat? We have squirrels around all the time and it feels normal."

"Hmm... cats are domesticated animals, and squirrels are wild, this cat behaves like a wild animal."

"Mhm," Sabina agreed, and scratched the tip of her nose.

They stopped talking again.

English classes passed without anything extraordinary. Sabina gave a ride to John to bring him home and then went home.


"Cats. What's the deal with cats?", the girl thought.

"Cats, cats, cats."

Traffic light showed a yellow. Sabina started braking. Traffic light turned to red.

On her left, a silver Porsche stopped. The girl looked in the Porsche's window. An old woman was sitting behind the wheel with a spotless hairdo, makeup, and spotless business suit. The woman looked into Sabina's eyes, slightly smiled, and nodded to her. The traffic light turned green. The Porsche turned left and Sabina proceeded forward.

The girl, upon arriving at her place, decided to take a shower. After showering, she put on a bathrobe and started brushing her long, blond, curly hair.

"OK Google, play the evening playlist," the girl asked.

Music started playing.

She felt hungry, so the girl went to the kitchen and started making spaghetti. She put sauce on the pan, then found a string cheese in the fridge and started nibbling on it.

There is a text message from John:

"How did you get home? What do you do?"

"Spaghetti", the girl replied.

"Got it, I am reading a book"

"What do you read?"

"Captain Grant's children"

"That's an interesting choice."

"Yep, for some reason I wanted to read that book, anyway I'll continue to read. Just wanted to check if you arrived home safely."

"Something interesting happened at the traffic light. I saw a woman in a silver Porsche, and for some reason, I'm still thinking about her; I have no idea why. She nodded to me, for some reason."

"Interesting."

"And cats."

"Cats, cats, cats, cats. Okey, I'll read XOXO"

Spaghetti finished cooking. Sabina put it on the plate and covered it with the sauce.

Google Mini plays Taylor Swift.

"OK Google, stop"

Music stopped. Sabina took the remote and started looking at what to watch on Netflix.

She finished her spaghetti and fell asleep without noticing it. She woke up at 2 in the night, put the plate in the dishwasher, and went back to bed.

## Chapter 2

Meow, meow! Cats were yowling outside. Sabina closed the window, trying to muffle the cats' meowing.

## Chapter 3

Sabina woke up slightly earlier than her alarm. The morning was cloudy. She had a physics class, math, and CAD workshop scheduled for today.

She went to the kitchen and made her breakfast. The kitchen was enveloped in a golden hue, the remnants of the rising sun peeking through the gaps of the clouds. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the room as Sabina toasted some bread and scrambled a couple of eggs.

While eating her breakfast, she recalled the previous day's events. The mysterious old lady in the Porsche and the constant appearance of cats left her deep in thought. Was there any connection, or was it just a peculiar coincidence?

Once she finished her meal, Sabina quickly prepared her backpack. Inside, she had her physics textbook, a math notebook, a set of pencils and pens, her CAD laptop, and its charger.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. It was a text from John.

"Morning, early bird! Did those cats keep you up again?"

She chuckled, replying, "Seems like it. They're becoming a regular nocturnal orchestra. Anyway, see you at university?"

"Absolutely. Coffee at 9?"

"Sounds like a plan."

Sabina left her apartment and walked to the car. The cool morning breeze ruffled her hair as she plugged in her earphones and began listening to a podcast about mysterious urban legends.

Next to her parking spot, an older man sat feeding pigeons. Nearby, a tabby cat watched intently, its tail twitching occasionally. Sabina approached the cat, kneeling down and extending her hand. The cat cautiously came forward, sniffing her fingers before rubbing its face against her hand. "Why are there so many of you around lately?" she whispered to the cat, smiling.

The journey to the university was uneventful, but her mind raced with theories about the sudden surge of cats in the city. Could there be an event or phenomenon causing this?

At university, John greeted Sabina with two cups of coffee in his hands. They sat at their usual spot in the courtyard, under an old oak tree.

"Have you ever wondered why there's been an increase in cat sightings recently?" Sabina began, taking a sip of her coffee.

John laughed, "You and your theories. What's next? The cats are spies from another dimension?"

Sabina smirked, "Well, not exactly. But I have this weird feeling there's more to it."

"Okay, let me hear it," John said, leaning forward.

"I think there might be a connection between the cats and the strange noises at night. Maybe they're attracted to something in the city? Maybe they're trying to tell us something?" Sabina suggested.

John shook his head, "That's ridiculous. Cats don't talk.  Besides, there are noises everywhere. It could be anything."

"But what if it's not just any noise? What if it's a specific sound or frequency that the cats can hear?" Sabina persisted.

John sighed, "You're really going to make me say it, aren't you? Fine. Let's go investigate. But if we don't find anything, you owe me a dinner. Deal?"

Sabina grinned, "Deal."

That night, they set out to explore the city. They walked for hours, listening intently for any unusual sounds or patterns. As midnight approached, Sabina felt a strange sense of anticipation. She couldn't shake off the feeling that something was about to happen.

"John, do you hear that?" she whispered, her eyes fixed on a nearby 24-hour diner.

"What?" John asked, cocking his head to the side.

"That... hum. It's so faint, but it's definitely there." Sabina's eyes sparkled with excitement.

John listened more closely, and after a moment, he nodded. "Yeah, I hear it too."

"What is it?" Sabina asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"I don't know, but I think we should follow it," John replied, his eyes scanning the surrounding area.

As they walked closer to the diner, the hum grew louder. Sabina felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that this was it – the moment they had been searching for.

"John, look!" she exclaimed, pointing to the diner's neon sign.

The letters "DINER" began to flicker, and the hum grew louder still. Sabina felt a strange energy emanating from the sign. It was as if the very fabric of reality was shifting.

"What's happening?" John asked, his voice full of wonder.

"I don't know, but I think we're about to find out," Sabina replied, her eyes fixed on the sign.

And then, everything went black.

## Chapter 4

Sabina's eyes fluttered open to an unfamiliar, dimly lit room. She lay on a cold, metal table, her head throbbing. John was nowhere to be seen. The room was filled with strange, glowing orbs that seemed to be watching her, their eerie light casting an unsettling ambiance.

"Hello?" Sabina called out, her voice trembling.

The silence was deafening. The orbs continued to glow, their unblinking gaze fixed on her. Sabina tried to sit up, but a sharp pain pierced her head, forcing her back onto the table with a gasp.

"John?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The silence was oppressive. Sabina was alone, and the orbs were closing in. She felt a strange, tingling sensation in her fingers and toes as they slowly drifted towards her.

"What's happening to me?" Sabina whispered, her voice full of fear.

The orbs surrounded her, their energy building up inside her. Just as everything was about to go black, she saw a face - the woman from the Porsche, the one she had seen at the traffic light.

## Chapter 5

Sabina woke up in her own bed, surrounded by the comforting familiarity of her apartment. Her heart raced as she lay on her back, struggling to recall the events of the previous night. Fragments of memories lingered - the strange hum, the flickering sign, and the orbs - but the details were hazy.

She wondered if she had really seen the woman or if it was just a hallucination. Sabina's mind swirled with questions, her thoughts racing to piece together the puzzle.

Reaching for her phone, she saw a text from John.

"Hey, how are you? I'm still trying to figure out what happened last night. Did you see anything?"

Sabina's heart skipped a beat as she read the message. She hesitated for a moment before typing out a response.

"I saw something. I'm not sure what it means, but I think we're in for something big."

John's response was immediate.

"Meet me at the university at 2 pm. We need to talk."

Sabina nodded to herself, feeling a sense of determination wash over her. She knew that she and John had stumbled upon something incredible, something that could change their lives forever. The uncertainty only fueled her resolve to uncover the truth.

As she drove to the university, Sabina couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She thought about the strange events of the previous night, the woman from the Porsche, and the cats. And then it hit her - she hadn't seen or heard any cats that morning. It was as if they had vanished into thin air.

Sabina parked her car in the university parking lot and got out, looking around at the deserted campus. The university was quiet, with only a few students walking around. She spotted John waiting for her near the entrance.

"Hi," John said, as Sabina approached him.

"Hi," Sabina replied. "Do you remember what classes we have today? I forgot."

"I think we have physics, math, and CAD workshop," Sabina replied.

"Right," John said. "Let's go to the physics class first."

As they walked to the physics class, Sabina noticed that the university was eerily empty. There were no students, no professors, no one. It was as if the university was abandoned.

"John, where is everyone?" Sabina asked, feeling a sense of unease.

"I don't know," John replied. "Maybe it's a holiday or something."

Sabina looked around, her eyes scanning the deserted hallways. That's when she saw it - a cat sitting on a bench, staring at her. Sabina felt a strange sensation, as if the cat was trying to communicate with her.

"John, look," Sabina said, pointing to the cat.

John looked at the cat. "What about it?" he asked.

"I think the cat is trying to tell us something," Sabina replied, her intuition kicking in.

"What do you mean?" John asked, skeptical.

"I don't know, but I feel it," Sabina said, her eyes locked on the cat.

John looked at the cat again, and this time, he saw something strange. The cat was staring at Sabina with an almost human-like intensity.

"Let's follow it," John said, his curiosity piqued.

The cat stood up and started walking towards them. Sabina felt a strange sensation in her head, as if she was being pulled towards the cat. They followed the cat, which led them to a strange, glowing portal. The portal was pulsing with energy, and Sabina could feel its power calling to her.

Spoiler: Cats are intelligent creatures with intelligence 100% higher than the average human.

Spoiler: A woman in a Porsche; her name is Sophia, who needs help from Sabina and John to save the world from an alien invasion. Sabina has a special ability to communicate with cats, and she is the only one who can help the woman in the Porsche, Sophia, to save the world. Sophia is the president of the Feline Council.

Spoiler: orbs are a form of feline technology that can manipulate the world. They are used by the feline council to communicate with humans and to manipulate the world. The orbs are also used to heal and to protect humans.

Spoiler: the university was empty that day because it was a holiday.

Spoiler: the room with a cold metal table was a feline laboratory where they were conducting experiments on humans.
